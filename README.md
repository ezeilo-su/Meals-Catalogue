# Meals Catalogue - React-Redux Capstone Project

![main page](home.png)

> In this project, I built a website a user can browse catalogue of meals. The app makes an external API request to retrieve a list of categories of meals as well as a list of meals in each category. The retrived API data is stored in the ```redux store``` and served the user according to some selected filters.

> ```React-Redux Hooks``` was used to fetch the requested data from the ```redux store```. 

> ```axios``` package was used for external API call.

> In order to allow an ```async action creator``` function to be returned on ```dispatch```, instead of the action itself, ```redux-thunk``` package was used alongside ```axios```.

> The app was successfully tested and deployed on heroku.
